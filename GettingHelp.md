# How to get help with your games

- First, first a page to post on, you probably already did this but there are some unspoken rules that most people expect you to abide by. This repo's purpose is to make said unspoken rules clear.

- Secondly, gather your system information with a program like fastfetch or neofetch
- Thirdly, gather logs. You can do this in a few different ways.

  - Option 1: Launch steam through a terminal and copy the output when you are starting the game you are troubleshooting.
  - Option 2: Use this launch argument for logs to generate inside /home/"yourusername": `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` (though personally I think this is a little annoying so I don't use this myself.)

- Fourthly, make your post. The ideal post contains: Your system information and logs related to your issue. That's it.

## "DOs" and "DON'T"s

- DO NOT post questions on channels with unreadable photos with 0 information or post

* DO ask for what info you would need to provide with an issue you're having if you are not sure how to gather logs or system information.

- DO NOT be rude to people trying to help you. Most people helping with tools like Proton and WINE are volunteers that do not get paid to deal with people's attitude. Doing this only makes your chances of receiving support worse, so be kind to your fellow penguin fans.

* DO thank the people trying to help you for their time. (even when they haven't fixed your problem)
