# List of Terminology used in this repo and communities related to Steam Play/Proton

- Prefix:
  To quote the ProtonDB Bot from the ProtonDB Discord server:
  "Proton creates a single WINE prefix for each game in a subfolder of the Steam library the game has been installed to. This subfolder is called compatdata and every prefix will have the App ID of the game as the name.

  As an example, we take The Witcher 3 which has the App ID 292030:

  `<SteamLibrary>/compatdata/292030/`

  If you have issues, you can delete that folder and Proton will create a fresh prefix the next time you launch the game.
  But be aware that save games and config files, which are not stored in the Steam Cloud, will be deleted that way. So it is recommended to make backups of those beforehand."
